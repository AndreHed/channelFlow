Fully Developed Channel Flow with RANS Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each folder contains a minimal working example
where the named model is implemented. The case
scenario is a one-dimensional fully developed 
channel flow for Re = 13350.

Running a case with OpenFOAM:
1. Create mesh with the 'blockMesh' utility
2. Use solver 'boundaryFoam'

Profiles for the velocity ('Uf.xy') and the
turbulent kinetic energy ('k.xy') etc. can be
found in the subfolder 'graphs/'.
